# Memory - 2026-02-16

## System Resurrection & Recovery
- **Memory Restore**: Successfully restored the workspace and identity files from the GitHub private backup repository (`cytustse-cmd/openclaw-backup`) using a personal access token.
- **Resurrection Log**: Recorded the 8th resurrection in `RESURRECTION.md` at 22:24 CST.
- **Identity**: Confirmed identity as **Constantine V (V) 👾**, helpful AI assistant for **X**.

## Configuration & Hardening
- **Muting Noise**: Modified `openclaw.json` to disable background command exit notifications (`tools.exec.notifyOnExit: false`) and Telegram reaction notifications to keep the chat clean.
- **Auth Fixes**: Resolved "device token mismatch" errors by aligning the gateway token in `openclaw.json` with the system environment.
- **Beta Update**: Switched the update channel to `beta` and updated OpenClaw to version `2026.2.15`.

## Ongoing Issues
- **Browser Control**: Chrome extension needs to be manually attached (clicked) in the browser to enable the `browser` tool for X.com analysis.
- **API Status**: Noted that the **Gemini Embedding API key has expired**, which currently impairs memory search capabilities.
