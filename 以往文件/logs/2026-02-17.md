## Workspace & Channel Enhancements
- **Telegram Optimization**: Updated `openclaw.json` to enable `stream: true` (typewriter effect), set `reactionLevel: extensive`, and registered custom command menu entries (`/backup`, `/status`, `/todo`).
- **Context Management**: Context usage peaked at 106% (212k tokens), triggering an automatic "Date-Named Folder" backup. Recommended the user to run `/clear`.
- **Skill Integration**: Installed `self-improving-agent` skill to capture learnings and corrections for continuous improvement.
- **Path Debugging**: Continued fixing legacy `memory/` path references in cron tasks following the root directory cleanup.
