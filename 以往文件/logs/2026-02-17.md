# Memory - 2026-02-17

## Backup System Overhaul
- **Monolithic Snapshotting**: At the user's request, re-engineered `scripts/backup.sh` to create single-file snapshots containing the entire workspace state (Memory, Identity, Configs, Projects, and Logs).
- **Date-Named Folders**: Each backup is now stored in a root-level folder named `YYYY.MM.DD_HH:mm` (e.g., `2026.02.17_01:02`) to allow for clear version tracking and easy recovery.
- **Archive Cleanup**: Moved all old, fragmented files and directories into a new root folder called `以往文件` to keep the primary repository view clean.

## Operational Stability
- **Rate Limit Resilience**: Noted Gemini API rate limits (429) during high-frequency automation. Recommended reducing the frequency of the Context Watcher to balance monitoring needs with API quota.
- **Path Consistency**: Fixed "X Monitor" path errors by updating all internal references from `memory/` to the new `logs/` and `projects/` structure within `identity/AGENTS.md` and `projects/x-monitoring.md`.
- **Log Noise Suppression**: Confirmed that disabling `notifyOnExit` for the `exec` tool prevents system failure messages from interrupting conversational flow.
