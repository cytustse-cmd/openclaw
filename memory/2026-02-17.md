## Storage & Maintenance
- **Backup Compression**: Compressed all snapshot directories in `backups/` into `.tar.gz` format. This was done to prevent the agent from accidentally re-ingesting large markdown snapshots during routine context checks (which previously caused 100%+ context spikes).
- **Hooks Configured**: Enabled the Hooks plugin. Generated a secure token (`hc_6cacc6a2be874e279b0b0d7162447073`) and set the default session to `agent:main:main`. This allows external systems to proactively send alerts or messages directly into this chat.
- **Service Verification**: Confirmed that `ClawNow.ai` is the official cloud hosting solution for OpenClaw, emphasizing its security features (isolated instances, hardened OS, and encrypted credentials).
- **Tavily Capabilities**: Verified Tavily search can index public content from X (Twitter), though it cannot "browse" private timelines or interact (like/repost) in real-time.
