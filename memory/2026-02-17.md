# Memory - 2026-02-17 (Update)

## System Configuration
- **OpenClaw Version**: Verified running on `2026.2.15` (beta channel), which is currently the latest available version.
- **QMC Enabled**: Successfully patched `openclaw.json` to enable `qmc` (Quantum Memory Compression) for agent compaction, replacing the previous `safeguard` mode.
- **Context Management**: 
    - Resolved a massive context bloat issue (up to 123%+) caused by large snapshot files being stored in the workspace root.
    - Adjusted `backup.sh` to move snapshots to a dedicated `backups/` directory, preventing them from being automatically re-ingested by the agent.
    - User requested that future backups focus only on "useful dry goods" (useful information) rather than a complete dump of all session noise.

## Session Maintenance
- **Cron Jobs**: Confirmed `Context Watcher` (every 15m) and `Daily Backup` (21:00 daily) are active and functioning correctly.
- **Persona & Tone**: Interaction level is currently set to `extensive` (Intensive), with active use of reactions and a proactive persona.
