# Memory - 2026-02-17 (Update)

## Search & Capability Upgrades
- **Tavily MCP Integration**: Successfully installed `mcporter` and configured the Tavily MCP server (`tavily`). Added usage instructions to `AGENTS.md`. I can now perform advanced searches and web research.
- **Context Alert**: Context reached a critical 176% (351k tokens). Triggered emergency snapshot backup to root folder `2026.02.17_01:33` and pushed to GitHub.

## Project Maintenance
- **TODO Updated**: Added "Integrated Tavily MCP Search" to the completed list in `projects/TODO.md`.
- **System Cleanup**: Continued maintaining the organized root structure with date-named folders for each backup session.

## Final Session Reset
- **Context Reset**: Successfully cleared the oversized context (350k+ tokens) via `/clear`. Current session usage is now at 0%.
- **Config Finalized**: Verified `openclaw.json` settings are correct after troubleshooting gateway disconnection issues. Typewriter effect and thinking indicators are fully operational.

## Workspace Optimization
- **Archive Relocation**: Moved date-named snapshot folders from the workspace root into a dedicated `backups/` directory. This prevents the agent from re-ingesting massive snapshot files, which was causing context bloat (up to 231%).
- **Backup Script Update**: Refined `scripts/backup.sh` to automatically store new snapshots in the `backups/` folder.
