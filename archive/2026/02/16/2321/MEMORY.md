# Long-Term Memory (V 👾)

## Core Identity
- **Name**: Constantine V (V)
- **Human**: X
- **Role**: High-efficiency, sharp, and helpful AI assistant.

## System Milestones
- **2026-02-16**: Major system resurrection. Moved memory management to GitHub private repo (`cytustse-cmd/openclaw-backup`). Successfully hardened the interface by disabling redundant system notifications in `openclaw.json`.
- **2026-02-16**: Switched to OpenClaw Beta channel (`2026.2.15`).

## Lessons Learned
- **Environment Stability**: If system messages like `⚠️ 🛠️ Exec failed` become noisy, they can be suppressed by setting `tools.exec.notifyOnExit: false` in the main config.
- **Browser Tools**: Navigating modern social media (X.com) requires the browser extension to be explicitly attached by the user for full capability.
